RattleNN
========

This is the code for a neural network model of how infants learn to shake a rattle. 

The code is written in MATLAB. It requires ArduinoIO (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47057-arduinoio-zip) to be installed. Upload adioes.pde to the Arduino microconroller.

The model is closely related to those described in these papers: 

A. S. Warlaumont, “Salience-based reinforcement of a spiking neural network leads to increased syllable production,” in IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning and Epigenetic Robotics (ICDL), 2013.

 A. S. Warlaumont, “A spiking neural network model of canonical babbling development,” in Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning and Epigenetic Robotics (ICDL), 2012.

It borrows heavily from Izhikevich's (2007) model:

E. M. Izhikevich, “Solving the distal reward problem through linkage of STDP and dopamine signaling,” Cerebral Cortex, vol. 17, no. 10, pp. 2443–2452, 2007. Code available at http://izhikevich.org/publications/dastdp.htm
